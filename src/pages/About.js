      <h1>About SlickTalk.ai</h1>
      <p>SlickTalk.ai is an AI voice-automation agency that answers calls, routes requests, books appointments, and follows up—24/7—for any business that relies on the phone. Our conversational agents sound natural, handle FAQs and intake, capture leads, schedule and confirm bookings, and trigger workflows in your existing tools. We design, deploy, and tune voice agents end-to-end (greetings, prompts, hand-offs, analytics) so you never miss a customer and your team gets time back.</p>
